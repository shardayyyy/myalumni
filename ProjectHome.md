  * The first cut of the code would be checked in very soon (Cleaning up), I would consider it to be in a beta version, but with still some generic customization to be done.

  * Looking for whom might take care of the look and feel to bring it up to date with what might look like a web 2.0 application.

  * Application currently supports Mysql and looking to port it to other databases
